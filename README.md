# Gene Expression Analysis in Cancer Research

This repository contains a sample project on gene expression analysis for cancer research. The database schema includes gene information, variants, sample data, and gene expression levels. This project helps to demonstrate how SQL can be used to analyze genetic data from various cancer types.

## Database Schema

- **genes**: Information about genes.
- **variants**: Genetic variants of specific genes.
- **samples**: Sample metadata, including cancer type.
- **gene_expression**: Gene expression levels for each sample.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites:
1. SQL Database system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
2. Basic understanding of SQL queries.

### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository:
